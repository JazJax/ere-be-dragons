# 'ere be dragons

"'ere be dragons" is a collection of badly written vulnerable codebases. These applications are used 
to test the [continuous-security](https://github.com/acodeninja/continuous-security) project.

### It should go without saying, but, *never* use these applications in any environment, ever, at all!
